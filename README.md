## TODO
* add mechanism to choose the triangle points and make sure the computed points fall well inside the triangle
* revert to object rather that structs

## Known issues and bugs:
* Well need to organize everything here
 
## Miscellaneous 
* This program generates variants of classic fractal structures (Sierpensky gasket/carpet, Julia set, Mandelbrot set)
