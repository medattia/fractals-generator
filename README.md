## What is this repository for?
* Quick summary:  
This repository contains implementations for the algorithm discussed in the book Chaos and Fractals: New Frontiers of Science by Peitgen, Jurgens and Saupe
Step by step I am adding code to the repository making it richer day by day.
   - 
* Version:  
In development 0.09 - December 2019

## How do I get set up?
* Summary of set up:  
   + Edit Makefile to compile the intended file
* Configuration:  
   + edit the cmake file or the make file to compile the algorithms
* Dependencies:  
   + OpenCV
* Hardware:  
 + PC

## Description of the included files 
* /src/chaos_game.cpp: draws the Sierpensky gasket using a scattered cloud of dots
* /src/fibonacci.cpp: computes the fibonacci sequence and pproximates the Golden ratio
* /src/MRCM.cpp: Multiple Reduction Copy Machine to get the sierpensky triangle/ gasket
* /src/newtons_method.cpp: computes the square of a given number
* /src/tent_transformation.cpp: write a sequence of numbers based on a combined formula
* /src/sierpensky_carpet.cpp: draws the  sierpensky carpet
* /src/cantor_set.cpp: displays the cantor set
* /src/pascals_triangle.cpp: computes the coefficients in Pascal's triangle

## TODO

* emprove the cantor set display
* edit cmake file 
* edit Makefile
* integrate the algorithms into one toolbox

## Known issues and bugs:
* well many things are to be optimized and emproved
 
## Miscellaneous 
* This program generates variants of classic fractal structures (Sierpensky gasket/carpet, Julia set, Mandelbrot set)
